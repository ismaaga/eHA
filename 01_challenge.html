             Oh, the beauty of moments,<br>
            Both bright and dark they come,<br>
            As we embrace them tightly,<br>
            And hold ourselves to some.<br>
            
            Our hearts yearn to express,<br>
            All the emotions we feel,<br>
            Weaving them into words,<br>
            And sharing what is real.<br>
            
            Yet, there is something special,<br>
            In silence, we can find,<br>
            As our hearts beat in rhythm,<br>
            Our souls become intertwined.<br>
            
            So let us embrace it all,<br>
            The beautiful and the rough,<br>
            For it is in these moments,<br>
            That life can beÂ enough.<br>
